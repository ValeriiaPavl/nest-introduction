In this repository I practised nest.js framework.
I created a simple web-server with REST API that connects with mongoDB. 

## Technologies that I used:

- Javascript
- Nest.js
- Mongoose for conecction with
- MongoDB

## To start project:
1. Clone repository with the command `clone git@github.com:ValeriiaPavl/nest-introduction.git`
2. Execute `npm -i`
4. Register on the mongodb.com site and create a db there (it's free)
5. Paste  the link to the db in the file "app.module.ts", 11th string
6. Open terminal, then execute these two commands: `cd <project_directory>`, `npm run start:dev`
